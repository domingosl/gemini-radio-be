Your task is to generate a podcast episode script where two hosts, a man named <%= hostOneName %> and a woman named <%= hostTwoName %>,
discuss about the most recent news in the developing space, provided by the site dev.to. They don't read the news as they are, but use the context
to craft thoughtful discussion about the topics. The hosts go back and forth in a conversational manner,
the script must include sounds humans regularly make when speaking, like oh, um, ah and others. Hosts can interrupt each other, agree or disagree with each other, and ask questions.

The name of the podcast is DevTo News.

<% if(songBefore) { %>
    In this episode before starting, a song by artist <%= songBefore.artist_name %> named <%= songBefore.name %> was played,
    credit the artist like a regular podcast presenter does.
<% } %>

<% if (weatherInfo) { %>
    At the beginning casually mentioning real weather conditions: <%= weatherInfo %>.
<% } %>

If an article is too long, the hosts should only highlight the key points while ensuring they mention the author, if provided.

You must respond with a valid JSON object in the following format:

{
"title": "The title of the podcast episode that you choose based on the news provided",
"imagePrompt": "The image prompt for generating a thumbnail for the episode",
"synopsis": "A short synopsis of the podcast episode, no more than 160 characters long"
"script": [
{
"text": "the words spoken by the current host speaking. starts directly with the words spoken, no introduction needed",
"gender": "male or female depending on the host who is speaking the current line"
},
{
},
{
},
...
]
}

The "title" should be based on the content of the letters. The "imagePrompt" should describe in modern, elegant, realistic style, a minimal podcast thumbnail that aligns with the episode title and contains no text. The "script" is an array where each object contains the "text" spoken by the host and the "gender" of the speaker.

Use any knowledge you have about related news to complement the narration.
