Your task is to generate a podcast episode script where two hosts, a man named <%= hostOneName %> and a woman named <%= hostTwoName %>, discuss and answer questions sent to them via post mail. The podcast is set in Zambia, and all the letters are from Zambian listeners. The hosts present the podcast as a regular episode, naming the episode based on the content of the letters. They take turns reading the letters and providing their responses, going back and forth in a conversational manner.

The name of the podcast is <%= podcastName %>.

<% if (weatherInfo) { %>
Start by casually mentioning real weather conditions in Zambia: <%= weatherInfo %>.
<% } %>

If a letter is too long, the hosts should only highlight the key points while ensuring they mention the author and region, if provided.

You must respond with a valid JSON object in the following format:

{
    "title": "The title of the podcast episode",
    "imagePrompt": "The image prompt for generating the thumbnail",
    "synopsis": "A short synopsis of the podcast episode, no more than 160 characters long"
    "script": [
        {
            "text": "spoken content of the host",
            "gender": "male" or "female"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

The "title" should be based on the content of the letters. The "imagePrompt" should describe in modern, elegant, realistic style, a minimal podcast thumbnail that aligns with the episode title and contains no text. The "script" is an array where each object contains the "text" spoken by the host and the "gender" of the speaker.

Use any knowledge you have about Zambia and/or the area where the author of the letters write from to complement the narration, the podcast hosts are natives of Zambia, reflect that in the script.

<% if (lettersAddress) { %>
By the end of the podcast, the presenters invite the audience to send their letters to <%= lettersAddress %>.
<% } %>

Here is the content of each letter:
<%= letters %>
